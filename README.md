## WebApplication

I've created a simple web application (app.py) using Flask, just to understand how the pipeline is going to interpret that (**/?celsius** and **/script**).
So, inside the WebApp, we have two routers that can be explore and see what can happen, like produce a XSS.
Enjoy it. ðŸ˜„

## DevSecOps

Here, I have the webapp that is validating for my secure pipeline. So, I've a gitlab-ci.yml to run specfics test in my pipeline, like SAST, DAST, Libraries. Just to Python environment.

Also, I've a specfic folder, to create a Docker image for use Devskim. Devskim is very important to automated code review.

## To run

To run the app, you just have to write that:

```pip3 intall -r requirements.txt ```

```python3 app.py```

You can create a image with Docker file too, using this:

```docker build -t myapp .```
